  * [Online platform for South Asian community development](http://voiceofsouth.org/)
Still in beta, this group blog offers insights into ICT4D projects in all over South Asia. Stories are for example: [wireless computer technology in Nepal](http://voiceofsouth.org) or a [rural ICT center along with Digital Photography Lab in Bangladesh. ](http://voiceofsouth.org)
  * [Best way to understand information and communication technologies for development](http://mayafrica.wordpress.com/the-abc-of-ict4d/)
Heloise Emdon from IDRC summarizies in his first blog post a [presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/kdiga/idrcpeople-media-i-t-22-jun07-ict4d/) about the ABC of ICT4D (information and communication technologies for development). I like to think of his
approach as of five dimesions to understand ICT: human, natural, financial, social and physical capital. However, in my opinion, the presentation lack some consistency.
  * [Ideas worth spreading: TED conference in Arusha, Tanzania](http://blog.ted.com/2007/08/tedglobal_premi_1.php)
Finally, the videos from the presenters of the first TED conference in Africa are available. In Germany the conference is unfortunately not well known although [Hans Rosling's presentation](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/92) about global health history is legendary. Especially interesing and contreversial is George Ayittey's presentation, which "unleashes an almost breathtaking torrent of controlled anger toward corrupt leaders and the complacency." I am very eager to see more presentations.
  * [What is Enterprise 2.0?](http://fredcavazza.net/2007/07/27/what-is-enterprise-20/)
[![enterprise20.jpg](/images/enterprise20.jpg)]()Fred Cavazza gives a detailed introduction to enterprise2.0 and developes a nice graphic schema for it. Whereas I kept [my post about enterprises2.0](http://www.crisscrossed.net/2007/06/10/what-is-enterprise20-five-pillars-for-efficient-knowledge-sharing/) short, he gives technical insights, possible deployments, and elaborates on micro-blogging for internal training.
