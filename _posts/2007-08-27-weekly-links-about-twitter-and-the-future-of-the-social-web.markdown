  * Who owns web2.0? 
Amy Webb made an interesting listing on the latest acquisition of media and web companies. A rather spooky video shows the outcome of too much media concentration: [Prometeus - The Media Revolution](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj8ZadKgdC0)

	
  * [Thinking about Twitter](http://www.fullcirc.com/weblog/2007/08/thinking-about-twitter-part-1-sharing.htm)
Nancy White wrote two excellent posts about the use of Twitter to share knowledge and its different effects on communication, networking and learning ([First post](http://www.fullcirc.com/weblog/2007/08/thinking-about-twitter-part-1-sharing.htm) / [Second post).](http://www.fullcirc.com/weblog/2007/08/thinking-about-twitter-part-2-in-my.htm)
I wrote a rather critical article about it, [but I will give Twitter a try now](http://twitter.com/ckreutz).

	
  * [Collaborative and collective intelligence](http://asc-parc.blogspot.com/2007/08/wisdom-of-crowd-collective-intelligence.html)
An interesting post that describes the differences between wisdom of crowds and collaborative work. Wisdom of crowds, where the collective is used to generate average data such as a tag cloud or to get the most interesting articles. Collaborative work is different in which people write together, for example, wikipedia entries or a [book](http://www.ageofconversation.com/).

	
  * Did you know2.0?
A very nice video that points some of the changes of our knowledge society and the effects of the social web for the future. A quote from the video: "The amount of technical information is doubling every two years. By 2010 it is predicted to double every 72 hours." [Karl Fisch](http://thefischbowl.blogspot.com/2007/06/did-you-know-20.html) did the video and invites for further discussions.
