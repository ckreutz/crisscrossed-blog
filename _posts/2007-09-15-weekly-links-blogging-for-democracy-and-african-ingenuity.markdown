  * **Two articles on mobile for development**
[_Mobiles for the 'world's poorest'_](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6986804.stm) is a new article from BBC, which describes how Jeffery Sachs _Millenium village project_ applies mobile phones. Another article describes how [PDAs are saving lives in Africa](http://www.undispatch.com/archives/2007/09/how_pdas_are_sa.php).
  * **[Blogging for democracy around the world](http://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2007/08/22/blogging-for-democracy-around-the-world/)**
Interesting interview with Antony Loewenstein, who talks about his trip to various countries to visits blogger writing for democracy. In his opinion "Blogs have certainly democratised the political process, and allowed “average” citizens the chance to engage." In another [guardian commentary](http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/antony_loewenstein/2007/07/shifting_sands.html) he argues in the context of the Arab world, that Bloggers "are challenging the political status-quo like never before, despite the risks in doing so."
  * **[Afrigadget](http://www.afrigadget.com/)**
A great blog from [Erik Hersman](http://www.whiteafrican.com/), [kikuyumoja](http://blog.uhuru.de/) and others, which shows the fascinating art of improvisation in Africa. Check out for example the [BodaPhone](http://www.afrigadget.com/2007/09/10/the-bodaphone-in-uganda/) or a [home made welding machine](http://www.afrigadget.com/2007/06/03/home-made-welding-machine/). The title of the blogs says it all: Solving everyday problems with African ingenuity.
