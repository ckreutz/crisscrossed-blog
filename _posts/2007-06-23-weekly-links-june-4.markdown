  * [Web 2.0 and Your Own Learning and Development](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5431152345344515009)
A great presentation by [Stephen Downes](http://www.downes.ca/) about how everybody can use these new tools of interaction to enlighten their personal learning.
  * [Mobile Phones and Social Activism](http://www.techsoup.org/learningcenter/hardware/page7216.cfm?rss=1)
Interesting article by [Ethan Zuckerman](http://ethanzuckerman.com/blog/) about "[Why cell phones may be the most important technical innovation of the decade](http://www.techsoup.org/learningcenter/hardware/page7216.cfm?rss=1)"
  * [The center for graphic facilitation](http://graphicfacilitation.blogs.com/)
This blog has a nice variety of posts on different visualization topics. I particularly like the post about [whiteboards](http://graphicfacilitation.blogs.com/pages/2007/05/whiteboard_tuto.html).
  * [Everything is Miscellaneous](http://www.everythingismiscellaneous.com/)
The blog behind the book by David Weinberger. I started reading the book and can highly recommend it. I especially like that it describes the phenomenon of the web and its social and political implications. I will write a full review about it soon. Here is a quote from David Weinberger from the enterprise2.0 conference this week:




> These are big changes, it’s not hype, it’s right at the heart of knowledge, authority, trust, and how it’s smudging the supply chain, the org chart. We are reshaping business, whether we like it or not. Business is changing from being ‘theirs’, to the remaking of knowledge and authority that is ours.
