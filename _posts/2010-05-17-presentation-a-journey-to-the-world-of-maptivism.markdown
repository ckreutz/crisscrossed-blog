A while ago I was asked, by [Markus Beckedahl](http://www.netzpolitik.org/), to present something on maptivism at the [re-publica conference](http://re-publica.de/10/).  And even though I am still exploring this new field, I tried to give an overview of the fascinating world of maptivism.

Here is a video of my presentation (33 min.), which also shows the slides I have included below. The first two minutes are in German (in the beginning I forgot I wanted to held the presentation in English in the first place). The presentation covers a lot of what I have been blogging about [here](http://www.crisscrossed.net/2009/09/14/maptivism-maps-for-activism-transparency-and-engagement/) and [there](http://www.crisscrossed.net/2010/01/15/5-innovative-examples-for-worldwide-maptivism/), but I also included some other great examples. The re-publica took place this year and, thanks to the organizer,  a lot more international and inspiring people got together in Berlin. It was great discussing digital activism with [Sokari Enkine](http://blacklooks.org/), [Sam Ben Gharbia](http://samibengharbia.com/), [David Sasaki](http://el-oso.net/blog/), [Rolf Kleef](http://www.drostan.org/) and [Tobias Eigen](http://www.kabissa.org).

Two days after, I joined the [Open Data Hackdays](http://opendata.hackday.net/), which I really enjoyed. I am often a bit critical about the missing engagement from the German social media scene for politics and transparency. But these two days I got to know an enthusiast group of people.
