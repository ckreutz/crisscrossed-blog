[Leila Summa](http://internal-relations.de/) has given a great presentation called "Wanted: Employee2.0 - when  technologies wait for their users." She presented it in German but here I have translate some parts. ([Complete presentation)](http://internal-relations.de/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/wanted_ma20_07122007_lsumma2.pdf). It underlines again how fast this new forms of communication and opportunities evolve, how much faster organizations need to react, and how profound the culture impact will be sooner or later.

I found especially these two slides intriguing because they describe the future development in work life, the visions of many enthusiastic people about cultural changes of the new web, and the personal effect on the employee. The first slide accurately describes the old way of work life for employee1.0. Translation starting from the top center then clockwise:

(1) material values, (2) life-time position, (3) security, (4) stability & continuity, (5) personal contacts with a friend, (6) employee as a cost factor, (7) top-down - one way communication, (8) internal communications, (9) belief in hierarchy, (10) days/hours,  (11) values of liability  and acceptance.

The second slide describes wonderfully how the present work life 2.0 hits the employee. Translation clockwise: (1) immaterial values, (2) manager for time/freelancing, insecurity, (3) flexibility & change, social contacts with many friends, (4) employee as a knowledge source, (5) bottom down - two way communication, (6) internal relations, (7) social network, (8) minutes/seconds, (9) values of self fulfillment.

These slides show the changes of work life and to which large extent this will be shaped by the web. It certainly shows some downsides as instant communications. Not without surprise I see more in newspapers articles with titles such as "in the future anonymity is a luxury" or "the happiness of being unattainable." What I miss on the slides is the culture of openness, sharing and the free flow of ideas in the participatory web.
