The new web does not only offer a great potential for development in different domains, it also has its implications for traditional development aid, said [Giulio Quaggiotto](http://psdblog.worldbank.org/) and Pierre Wielezynski in their [recent article, "](http://www.freepint.com/issues/240507.htm#feature)Development 2.0: A New Paradigm for the Non-Profit Sector?" The authors highlight different facets of web2.0 (e.g. free development data, the long tail and collective intelligence) and how it has already changed the nonprofit sector.

In my opinion, particular NGOs and new webbased actors redefine development and challenge traditional development agencies.
