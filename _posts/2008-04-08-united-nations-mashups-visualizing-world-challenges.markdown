It is quite exciting to see that the United Nations and their different branch-organizations are slowly harnessing the potential of the web in innovative ways. I have previously [blogged about the idea of a huge interesting UN aggregator project and the UNDP water wiki during the last web4dv conference](http://www.crisscrossed.net/2007/12/03/notes-from-the-web4dev-conference/). To offer openly information sources and especially to visualize information is essential to understand our complex word from different perspectives.

[Gapminder](http://gapminder.org/) is a great example for that. And another one is the tactical technology collective with this booklet: [Visualizing Information for Advocacy: An Introduction to Information Design. ](http://www.tacticaltech.org)

It is promising to see that UN organizations such as UNEP follows the same steps and offers the **[Atlas of Our Changing Environment on Google Maps](http://na.unep.net)**:


> Through	illustrations, satellite images, ground photographs and powered by [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/), 			this interactive media depicts and describes  			humanity's past and present impact on the environment.


Today also UNHCR announced a mashup with Google Earth Outreach program, ["which punveiled a powerful new online mapping programme that provides an up-close and multifaceted view of some of the world's major displacement crises and the humanitarian efforts aimed at helping the victims."](http://www.unhcr.org/news/NEWS/47fb8b5b2.html)

[Here is the actual site](http://www.unhcr.org), but you need Google Earth to load it.

Patrick Philippe Meier writes about it: "[the next step for an iRevolution is to enable refugees to access this information on a regular basis. This need not require high-technology. The information could be broadcast by radio, for example.](http://irevolution.wordpress.com/2008/04/08/unhcr-google-earth-layer-released/)" **I believe it will become even more effective when refugees themselves can add information and update those visualized contexts from their perspective. **

One other excellent source was recently launched, [UNdata](http://data.un.org/), with over 55 million records and comprehensive statistics.
