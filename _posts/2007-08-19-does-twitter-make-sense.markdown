To begin with, I have to say, I am not a Twitter user. I have signed up for [an account](http://twitter.com/ckreutz) but have not used it at all. I, personally, prefer tools such as Skype. But still, I am willing to be convinced that it does bring an advantage for personal use.  I imagine it can be very useful, though, so far, it seems to me another 'great time consuming application.'  I wonder whether it is really an advantage to be [hyperconnected](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1607260,00.html). "Like any good pusher, services like Twitter don’t answer existing needs; they create new ones and then fill them. ([Times](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1607260,00.html))" I sense it speeds up the anyway fast communication and information sharing through the web. However, I also imagine it can be an application for new senseful forms of communication, activism and networking, especially with its connection to the mobile phone.
Given that assumption, I collected the following links about twitter:




  * [Mexico City's Earthquake, reported on Twitter first](http://scobleizer.com/2007/04/12/mexico-city-earthquake-reported-on-twitter-first/)
  * [The Potential of Twitter in Africa](http://soyapi.blogspot.com/2007/03/potential-of-twitter-in-africa.html) and [map of Twitter in Africa
](http://twitterfacts.blogspot.com/2007/07/twitter-in-africa.html)
  * "So the launching of Twitter provides a good alternative considering that the use of mobile phones is much higher than that of computers. In Malawi for example, there are about 50,000 Internet users against about 700,000 mobile phone users out of a population of about 12 million.

"Twitter might play a substantive role in emergency response because of its ability to share location-based, real-time information among social networks."
  * Activism: [Urgent Action IM Bots and Twitter for Darfur
](http://internetartizans.co.uk/urgent_action_im_bots_and_twitter_for_darfur)"But to me the critical thing about Twitter is the way it can be updated (and read) via mobile, and how that can reach in to urgent areas or situations in a way the internet can't (yet)."
  * Human rights: [Global Voices is now on Twitter](http://www.globalvoicesonline.org/2007/04/03/global-voices-is-now-on-twitter/)
  * [How human rights activists use Twitter ](http://ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2007/05/18/never-thought-of-using-it-that-way/)
"My favorite example of repurposing recently is my friend Alaa’s use of Twitter to coordinate activities of activists in Egypt."


These articles show how Twitter can be used in all sorts of ways, such as to allow fast messaging and alert a network. It seems good to give notice and to feel connected. It can be an important tool for activism because it pings every member of a network and it is more personal and directed than blogs. I imagine also twittervision version for human rights worldwide or environmental violations in a region.
