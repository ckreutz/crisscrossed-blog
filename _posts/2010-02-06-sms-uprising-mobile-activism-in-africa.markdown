The new opportunity to have activism through mobile phones is fascinating. I  have already often written about it. A while ago [Sokari Enkine](http://www.blacklooks.org/) asked me to [write a chapter for a recent published book](http://fahamubooks.org/book/?GCOI=90638100577370&fa=sommaire) funded by [Hivos](http://www.hivos.nl/). I wrote about future trends and software developments, and then [blogged about some possible trends and got some interesting feedback](http://www.crisscrossed.net/2008/12/15/future-trends-of-mobile-activism/) to use in the article.

I have also had some inspiring discussions with [Ken Banks](http://www.kiwanja.net/) and [Patrick Meier](http://irevolution.wordpress.com/), resulting these in the coming up of some scenarios such as a growth in local mobile innovation in Africa. If we [look at the topics and the discussion of the latest Mobile Web East Africa conference](http://bankelele.blogspot.com/2010/02/mobile-web-east-africa-day-one.html), we are witnessing a fascinating rise of creative mobile programming.

The [Guardian wrote a nice review of the book](http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/katine-chronicles-blog/2010/feb/02/mobile-phone-sms-uprising) and, although I also wrote about different types challenges too, the author Anne Perkins rated me as an optimist – I can live with that.


> The trouble with people who know about mobile phone technology is that they are a lot better at good ideas than they are at explaining to non-techies what their good ideas are for. So I fell upon SMS Uprising: Mobile activism in Africa, a collection of essays by people who either write mobile applications or transfer them to the field, hoping that at last I would understand not so much what's going on as how.




> SMS doesn't always work (sometimes texts are just too slow). But this is a handbook for the small NGO or social change activist who is daunted by technology. Help is at hand, and SMS Uprising will help you find it.


I hope the little introduction has made you enough curious by now! You can [order the book directly at Fahamu](http://fahamubooks.org/book/?GCOI=90638100577370&fa=sommaire) or at other book sellers for around 15$.
