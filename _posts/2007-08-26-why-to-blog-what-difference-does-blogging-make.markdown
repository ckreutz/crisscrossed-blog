There are many different types of blogging. [Rohit Bhargava](http://rohitbhargava.typepad.com/) shows us 25 different ones in [his presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/rohitbhargava/the-25-basic-styles-of-blogging-and-when-to-use-each-one/), starting from insight over piggyback to bridge blogging. What fascinates me the most, it is the reasons why people blog. Throughout the last months bloggers tagged each other: [Why Do You Blog?](http://www.soloseo.com/why-blog-meme.html) These are some examples showing how different but also how similar the reason's for blogging are:

[Way more down-to-earth is a Pew Internet study](http://www.pewinternet.org/PPF/r/186/report_display.asp) which summarizes the following top reasons of why people blog:



	
  1. to express yourself creatively

	
  2. to document your personal experiences or share them with others

	
  3. to stay in touch with friends and family

	
  4. to share practical knowledge or skills with others

	
  5. to motivate other people to action

	
  6. to entertain people

	
  7. to store resources or information important to you

	
  8. to influence the way other people think

	
  9. to network or to meet new people

	
  10. to make money


Personally, I find much more inspiring what [Esra from Bahrain](http://www.mideastyouth.com/2007/08/13/why-do-we-blog/) writes about:


> In this new age of information technology, not only are blogs used to inform, but to help us network with other like-minded individuals from across the globe. In the Arab world, political activism through blogging is becoming more common, and is actually influencing a lot of the mainstream media outlets, pressuring them to cover human rights violations.




> Blogging can be used for cross-cultural understanding and dialogue, and there are more and more pan-Arab group blogs emerging. Personally, I share a group blog with other young writers from Mauritania, Tunisia, and Morocco; something which helps me understand their cultures better. Had it not been for blogging, I would be embarrassingly ignorant about them and their societies, even though these are fellow Arabs I am talking about.


The web and particularly personal stories from people in blogs make us aware of how it is to live in different places. Blogging bridges cultures, opens unlimited network potential, and helps us to overcome strangeness. But I see one problem, to bridge countries, cultures and communication, we need a common language such as English. However, when we are writing in one only common foreign language, we will eventually limit ourselves to not be able to express fully our thoughts. To be continued ...
