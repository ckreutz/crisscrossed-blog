Open source software has become a strong movement and as it gains popularity it leads most software companies to engage with the expanding [open source community](http://www.github.com). All things digital, being it [music](https://soundcloud.com/groups/open-source-music), [photos](https://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/), etc., have in one way or another become free thanks to [some clever licenses](https://search.creativecommons.org/). What is not so often noticed is how the vision of open source spreads to other sectors and leads to a fascinating array of tools, thanks for example to 3D printing, and communities, which form a new way of open collaboration. I made a small exploration to search for great projects. 

To begin with, there is a nice definition by the University of  Hamburg:
> Open Source Innovation, according to our definition, refers to an innovation, which is (1) generated through volunteer contributions and (2) characterised by a non-market transfer of knowledge between the actors involved in invention and those involved in exploitation.
