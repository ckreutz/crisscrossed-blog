I just stumbled over [deliGoo](http://www.deligoo.com/en/), a great new search mashup. It combines del.icio.us and Google's custom search. That means, it can search for a keyword through all the websites of the 2829 bookmarks in [my del.icio.us account](http://del.icio.us/ckreutz). This gives me amazingly relevant results because my del.icio.us bookmarks represent my own web of topics--those I am interested on.

You have to install [deliGoo](http://www.deligoo.com/en/) in your Firefox browser. When you run it the first time, it takes some time to include all your bookmarked websites into Google's custom search. But then, once it is done, you can search through all these websites by typing any keyword. Now I am even happier of  having invested so much time bookmarking so many websites that are part of my personal knowledge management. [<strike>Here is my deliGoo search</strike>](http://www.search.deligoo.com/results.htm?cref=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.search.deligoo.com%2Fxml.php%3Fauth%3Ddcaf0ca7ab96ee3a2ec10c95def188eb&q=&sa=Search&client=pub-3954552390683645&cof=FORID%3A10&channel=6843236592&n=ckreutz&t=#0) (Sorry works only with the firefox plugin.)

One can also search single tags in [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) too. For example the [NPK4DEV](http://del.icio.us/tag/npk4dev) (nonprofit knowledge management for development) tag, which is collaboratively used by various people, offers great websites. That way you can search in websites chosen by people for being interesting and valuable. Not surprising, the results are far better. To me, it is another step proving that web2.0, with such tools, makes the web more useful and handy to anyone.
