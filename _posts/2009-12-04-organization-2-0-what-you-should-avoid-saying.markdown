This is for all of you, who share the daily burden to convince people for open knowledge sharing through the Internet for the benefit of all. That outdated hierarchies contradict potentials free flows of ideas and creative work in self-responsible teams and the persistence to follow-top down work styles and information-flows.




Here comes a list of statement you might (or not) avoid to say when you want to convince colleagues or clients for such changes. Please share more as I am sure you have plenty. ;-)




* Tell the IT people that there are stuck in the 80's, far from reality and will soon be obsolete.
* We will not implement a website. It will be a mashup consisting of social networks, blogs, wikis, widgets, maps and much more.
* Let us move the informal conversation online. We will have real-time interaction from all employees tweeting 9-5.
* Forget about email. It is oudated and we will share openly information across departments and hierarchies.
* Inside - outside does not matter anymore, so re-think your Intranet and open it.
* Let's give up the documentation management system and let all employees tag files how they think it is best.
* You know that the Intranet with organizational structure does not corresponded at all to the dispersed expertise in your organization.
* Yes sure we can measure the results of online knowledge sharing and prove each invested penny.
* Your employees will have full control of the website themselves and we turn off the workflow function.
* Forgot about desktop solutions. Outource your applications to external providers.
* We do it the wiki fashion - everybody add expertise where they know it better across your organization web.
* Â Have you heard of Firefox and Skype? They are dangerous tool luckily blocked by our firewall.
