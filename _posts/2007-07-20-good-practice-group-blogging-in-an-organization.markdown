For the  "[I collaborate, e-collaborate, we collaborate](http://icollaborate.blogspot.com/2007/07/roadblogs-gtz-egypts-experiences-of.html)"Â  blog, I wrote a post about internal organizational blogging, as an example of how web2.0 can be used to change communications and enhance knowledge sharing. Behind "e-collaborate", there is a great community of pratice to exchange experiences for online knowledge sharing and collaboration.

[![Blogging changes communication](/images/gtz.jpg)]()Blogging changes communication. This post is an attempt to summarize my group blogging experiences since the last two years. In the post, I describe the implementation, crititcal factors and results. What really strikes me is that internal blogging can change communication, lead to a better knowledge sharing, and from my experience, it can also become sustainable. The blog has become a community of its own which is driven by the users, who are equally readers and authors.
