Social innovation labs are increasingly popping up and evolving all over the world. They mostly focus on startups and business development around topics such as energy, environment, civic participation or the [cities as a laboratories](https://medium.com/@aschrock/why-do-we-talk-about-cities-as-laboratories-c3d70ff7244f#.14wlgvm2h). For an introduction to social innovation read my [blog post](http://www.crisscrossed.net/2014/12/18/introduction-social-and-open-innovation/).

Most buzz is often about innovation labs focusing on startups (incubators and accelerators) often sponsored by venture capitalists or companies with a clear for-profit focus. But a lot is happening outside this scope focusing on people, society, challenges and how new technologies and new form of cooperation can result in change and impact. If you think that this is still at its beginning, you are most probably right, but the innovation lab landscape is changing quickly – just look at the [Fablab movement](http://www.fabfoundation.org/) or Google's recent venture, [Sidewalk Lab](http://www.wired.com/2016/02/googles-city-fixing-sidewalk-labs-is-finally-getting-to-work/).

Some thoughts I took out of this research:

- These social innovation labs are hosted and organized through very different actors such as civil society or businesses although most are run by governments. These innovation labs show that the traditional organizational and sectoral boundaries have become blurry--an important development towards systemic social innovation as they would not work in a traditional silo thinking.
- The same "tearing down boundaries" applies to the outcome of these labs: the projects, organizations and businesses. There are many experiments with different business models ranging from non- to for-profit or combining the two. Particularly for social enterprise a lot of creativity is needed to find sustainable business models.
- Another observation is that these innovation labs take very different types of participation focusing on small groups, whole neighbourhoods or specific segments with different methodologies. There are  interesting learnings taking place to reach more impact through such labs, but it also raises many question on how these projects can be scaled in other locations. These and other questions are probably on the agenda of the upcoming [innovation labs conference](http://innovationlabsworld.com/).
