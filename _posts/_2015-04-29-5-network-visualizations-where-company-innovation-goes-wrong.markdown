Visualization are powerful as they show a lot more than words can tell. We love to watch on innovation environments from a bird-view to see how knowledge sharing and learning is happening. Is it a highly active community? Highly diverse and a fine network connecting many dots, which tells you a lot about the level of innovation an organization stands. To show the power of social network analysis we put together some intriguing network visualization that tell a story by themselves.

## Visualizations network innovation works and where not

One of the biggest challenges for organizations is the constant need for innovation – creating an environment of knowledge sharing and common learning, where ideas can easily flow, are collaborated on and have a chance to be realized or implemented.

Constraints such as time, resources, hierarchies, regulations, and so on are often what hinders these processes. Ideas for improvement, productivity and efficiency are not restricted to time or places – they pop-up anywhere at any time, during lunch breaks, under the shower, at meetings, etc. Therefore, innovation cannot be squeezed into just another process regularly packaged and executed. It is all about organizational culture and learning to learn from each other.

## Birds of a feather...are bad innovators
As the well known saying goes, “birds of a feather flock together”, we all have a tendency to befriend and interact with people with whom we have something in common or share similar interests, characteristics and ideas. This principle is called homophily. A quick survey among your friends and people you get along with will in all likelihood confirm it. Look at your friends’ age, education, political views, ethnicity and compare them to your own as well as each others.

The same applies to the workplace and there is an obvious reason for this. Standing on common ground tremendously facilitates communication and overall well being - these people “get you”. If they are colleagues, sitting down with them for a brainstorming session to come up with new ideas is usually a very satisfying experience – there is a great dynamic as you toss ideas around, right? There is obviously nothing wrong with that per se. On the contrary, informal networks of like minded people are imperative for any organization to work smoothly.
The problem is that that kind of cozy environment is often not very conducive to producing good ideas, or as Ethan Zuckerman has put it “homophily can make you stupid”. Common sense as well as a growing body of scientific studies dictates that creativity comes from “thinking outside of the box” or “leaving one’s comfort zone”. Another term that has gained prominence in the context of innovation is “serendipity” – roughly understood as the unpredictable circumstances and chance encounters that can lead to new insights.

> “[Successful idea flows depend] greatly on the quality of exploration and that, in turn, relies on the diversity and independence of our information and idea sources. By harvesting from the parts of our social network that touch other streams — that is, by crossing what sociologist Ron Burt called the “structural holes” within the fabric of society — we can create innovation. When we choose to dip into a different stream, we bring up new habits and beliefs, and it is these innovations that help us make better decisions, and help our community to thrive. [Quote by Alex Pentland](http://www.wired.com/2014/02/ideas-flow/)”

## Are you still innovating inside the box?

Think outside the box...but where is the box?
The problem is: “How do we find “the box”?” and  “can we create “serendipity”, which by it’s very definition is characterized by spontaneity and a lack of controlling mechanisms. The answers are “social network analysis” and “monitored open innovation”, respectively.
For finding isolated communities of practice – “the box” –  in a bounded network such as a firm, we can use organisational network analysis to find patterns and clusters of connectivity (e. g.who communicates with whom?) which we could then use to “mix it up” and “create” a serendipitous environment.We could, for example, put the least connected, most peripheral people together in a brainstorming session or, at least, make sure that they participate alongside the more obvious choices.

Network maps  give us a bird’s eyes view of informal channels of communication beyond the official organisational structures. And as Alex Pentland shows in his book Social Physics, there are ways to influence such innovation networks for more social learning and eventually deeper innovation. A good way to foster innovation is implementing an  open innovation platform, but even in open innovation formats people often suffer from confirmation bias and tend to form clusters with those who support their opinions and leave those discussions in which popular opinion runs contrary to their ideas. To quote Alex Pentland, “...our hyperconnected world may be moving toward a state in which there is too much idea flow. In a world of echo chambers, fads and panics are the norm — and so it is much harder to make good decisions. We need to pay much more attention to where our ideas are coming from, and we should actively discount common opinions and keep track of the contrarian ideas.”
