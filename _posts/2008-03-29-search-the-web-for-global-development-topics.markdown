If you want to find decent information about development aid, [Focuss.info](http://www.focuss.info/) is a good source to start from. Basically, it works with a customized Google search, which allows you to search only certain websites -- in this case, within many websites relevant to development aid. [Focuss.info](http://www.focuss.info/), an initiative by the <strike>[Overseas Development Institute](http://blogs.odi.org.uk/blogs/main/)</strike> [ISS institute](http://www.iss.nl/) and in particular Richard Lalleman, goes one step further indexing websites from a [community of social bookmarkers](http://www.focuss.info). So, through [my del.icio.us account](http://del.icio.us/ckreutz), I can contribute to the search easily with my bookmarks. Through a RSS feed, all of these bookmarks are added to the search engine.

The other day I got an email from Richard, telling me I was the social bookmarker of the month. Many thanks! To me, social bookmarking is one of the key tools of the participative web, which gives me valuable information. So, if you also share bookmarks and are interested in topics related to development, you should join this community. Send an email to: info(dot)focuss(at)gmail(dot)com.

And to conclude, for more information about the web2fordev conference, Arne Wunder and Paul Matthews gave a presentation about the evolutionary history of focuss.info.
